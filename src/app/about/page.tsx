          About Antiquitas Interactive
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Antiquitas Interactive emerged from a lifelong fascination with ancient history, particularly the rich tapestry of the ancient Mediterranean world. This project aims to bridge the gap between academic historical study and interactive digital experiences, offering a unique platform for engaging with historical figures and events.

          Our Origins
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          The seed of this project was planted in childhood, with early exposure to historical strategy games like Age of Empires. These games sparked a passion that led to formal study of ancient Greek history at the university level. Antiquitas Interactive is the culmination of years of academic pursuit and a desire to make historical engagement more accessible and interactive.

          Technological Fascination
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          The concept of Antiquitas Interactive draws inspiration from science fiction, notably Star Trek&apos;s Holodeck. While we&apos;re not yet able to create fully immersive physical environments, this project represents a step towards interactive historical simulations. It demonstrates how technology can be leveraged to create engaging educational experiences that blur the lines between learning and entertainment.
